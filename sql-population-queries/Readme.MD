##  Project Requirements

In this project, we’ll answer questions using a database of world population by country.

The schema of the database is:
<br>
Column 	Type 	Notes<br>
country 	STRING 	<br>
population 	NUMBER 	(in millions)<br>
year 	NUMBER 	

Refer to this schema as we write queries to the database.

### When we finish this project, we should be able to answer each the questions that follow using a single SQL query.

1. What years are covered by the dataset? 
Continue adding your queries below the first one as you proceed.

2. What is the largest population size for Gabon in this dataset?

3. What were the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?

4. What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 million in the year 2010?

5. How many countries in this dataset have the word “Islands” in their name?

6. What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?

Note: it’s okay to figure out the difference by hand after pulling the correct data.
